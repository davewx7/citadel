"<font size='+50%'>New Cards, Rule Changes</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Oct 5, 2017</i></font>
- We have added three <i>'Radial Lands'</i> to the core set. How do they work? Rather than affecting creatures in the lane, they affect your <i>Nearby</i> creatures. A creature is nearby if it's on the tile the lane is on or on one of the neighboring tiles. Radial Lands intend to encourage risk-taking: the most strategic positions for these lands are ones where they are most likely to be captured. Without further ado, we present the <font tag='obj:card:Glade of Fury'>Glade of Fury</font>, the <font tag='obj:card:Dark Spire'>Dark Spire</font>, and the <font tag='obj:card:Temple of Triumph'>Temple of Triumph</font>.
- Some additional spell cards have been added, including <font tag='obj:card:Terramorph'>Terramorph</font>, <font tag='obj:card:Ambush'>Ambush</font>, and <font tag='obj:card:Last Stand'>Last Stand</font>.
- Rule changes/fixes: Valiant creatures now die at the end of the turn rather at the start of the next turn. This means that cards such as Hypothermia can kill Valiant creatures. Furious Rampage now kills Cave Troll like it does any other creature.
- We are trialing removing the rule that made it so that spells and abilities cannot finish players off. Now, Fireballs, Blood Altars, and even your own Skeletal Parasites can kill you. We found that it was making some matchups just take too long, becoming stalemates without effects like this working.
- Some removal spells have been mildly nerfed, such as Polymorph. Also, Oil of Anointing received a small nerf.

"<font size='+50%'>Patch Notes</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Oct 1, 2017</i></font>
- Fixed a campaign bug in Irendahl fields which prevented progressing beyond 75% completion.
- Changed rules regarding where a land can be conjured, to prevent conjuring a land on a tile where an enemy creature is.
- Added animation when you take damage from the shadow deck
- Made it so creature abilities that do damage to players without killing them don't reduce life below 1. Previously the life would drop below 1 momentarily before being restored, which was confusing.
- Fixed some bugs in the library/shop allowing you to purchase cards even when you had insufficient funds.
- Made it so clicking a creature with movement and activated abilities will access the creature's activated abilities. Clicking that creature a second time will cause it to move.

<font size='+50%'>Introducing the <i>Soul Thief</i></font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Sep 20, 2017</i></font>
<font tag='obj:card:Soul Thief'><img src='images/portraits/card-size/vampire.png' width='116'/></font>

Replacing the <i>Vampire</i> card, the <i>Soul Thief</i> steals both the attack and life of its victims adding them to its own totals when killing an enemy creature. How large can your Soul Thief grow?

<font size='+50%'>Some Small Tweaks</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Sep 7, 2017</i></font>
A variety of cards have been tweaked lately, including making the 'hero' cards a little less powerful.

You can now move individual creatures by clicking on them if you want to choose the order in which creatures move. Buying now works in both possible views in the library.

<font size='+50%'>A Sapling Grows</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>May 13, 2017</i>
</font>
We have reworked the <font tag='obj:card:Treant Sapling'>Treant Sapling</font>. It starts out as a piddling little 3/3 for 3, but each turn that you keep it in your hand it grows a little larger. How long will you keep it in your hand before deciding it's time to unleash it on the battlefield?

Our new settings UI design is intended to be streamlined, attractive and easy to use.
